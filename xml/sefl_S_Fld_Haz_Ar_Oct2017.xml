      <abstract>This dataset contains information about the flood hazards within the study area. These zones are used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to designate the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) and for insurance rating purposes. These data are the flood hazard areas that are or will be depicted on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). There is one polygon for each contiguous flood zone designated. This information is required for all draft Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps. The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event (100 year), the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event (500 year), and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by FEMA. This dataset is an update to the DFIRM_FLDHAZ_MAY16 layer.</abstract>
      <purpose>The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which "... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, " Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The FIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The FIRM Database serves to archive the information collected during the Flood Risk Project.</purpose>
      <supplinf>What Is an LFD? 
A Letter of Final Determination (LFD) is a letter the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sends to the Chief Executive Officer of a community stating that a new or updated Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) will become effective in 6 months. The letter also notifies each affected flood prone community participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that it must adopt a compliant floodplain management ordinance by the map effective date to remain participants in good standing in the NFIP.

It was noted that sliver polygons existed (primarily in Charlotte County).
However, no methodology was performed by GeoPlan to correct for these issues.
For more information on FEMA's Final Data Structure concerning sliver polygons 
please see below.
The FEMA report frm_gsal.pdf states the following regarding sliver polygons.
L.3.5.2 Topology
Vector data files must meet the following data structure requirements:
* Area spatial features for a given theme must cover the entire study area 
without overlaps, underlaps or sliver polygons between adjacent polygons.

Next Deleted the following 3 features due to spatial errors: 
12123C_10583 (Duplicate Polygon), 
12111C_1676 (Zero Area), 
12097C_502 (Negative Area).

It was noted that 45 features had vertex counts greater than 500,000. 
Features with large vertex counts are known to cause database analysis crashes and errors. 
The ArcGIS Dice Tool subdivides a feature into smaller features based on a specified vertex limit. This tool is intended as a way to subdivide extremely large features that cause issues with drawing, analysis, editing, and/or performance but are difficult to split up with standard editing and geoprocessing tools. This tool should not be used in any cases other than those where tools are failing to complete successfully due to the size of features.

The following 45 features were subdivided using the ArcGIS Dice Tool with a vertex limit of 350,000.

** What is a "100-year flood" and how is it different from a "1-percent-annual-chance flood" or a "base flood?" ** The term "100-year flood" is misleading. It is not the flood that will occur once every 100 years. Rather, it is the flood that has a 1-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded each year. Thus, the 100-year flood could occur more than once in a relatively short period of time or even within the same month. Because this term is misleading, FEMA has also defined it as the "1-percent-annual-chance flood." The "1-percent-annual-chance flood" is the term that is now used by most federal and state agencies and by the National Flood Insurance Program.

** The following FEMA DFIRM information is from the frm_gsalb.pdf ** Table: S_Fld_Haz_Ar This table is required for all draft Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map data. The S_Fld_Haz_Ar table contains information about the flood hazards within the study area. A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. These zones are used by the federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to designate the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) and for insurance rating purposes. These data are the flood hazard areas that are or will be depicted on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. The spatial elements representing the flood zones are polygons. The entire area of the jurisdiction(s) mapped by the FIRM should have a corresponding flood zone polygon. There is one polygon for each contiguous flood zone designated. This is a modified Standard DFIRM Database table that includes Standard DFIRM Database items and Enhanced Database items. All items after SOURCE_CIT are Enhanced. Table: D_Zone Where the 1-percent-annual-chance flood or the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood is contained in a culvert or channel, a corresponding feature appears in the S_Fld_Haz_Ar table only if an SFHA or 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood zone is shown on the FIRM in this area. In general, these culverts and channels are to be represented in the general structure table regardless of how the flood insurance risk zones are depicted. So, if these structures are shown on the FIRM as a dashed line passing through a Zone X, no corresponding flood insurance risk zone is shown in S_Fld_Haz_Ar table in the DFIRM database. If a narrow SFHA or 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood zone is shown on the FIRM, then a narrow polygon must be included in the DFIRM database. If the width of this flood insurance risk zone is accurately known and represented in the spatial data, the normal flood insurance risk zone is applied. If the width of the flood insurance risk zone is not accurately known and represented because of scale limitations, then the zone is designated as 1-percent-annual-chance flood contained in channel or 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood contained in channel as appropriate.

This is the flood insurance risk zone designation. These zones are used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to designate Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) and for insurance rating purposes. Some older FEMA FIRMs were prepared in the Standard format that uses Zones B, C and numbered A and V zones. Newer FIRMs use the Map Initiatives format where the B corresponds to 0.2 pct ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD HAZARD; C corresponds to Zone X; numbered A zones (e.g., A1, A2, A3) correspond to Zone AE; and numbered V zones (e.g., V1, V2, V3) correspond to Zone VE. All Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRMs) should use the Map Initiatives zone designations. See Volume 1, Subsection 1.4.6.1.5 of these Guidelines for details on the flood insurance risk zones. (NOTE: The symbol '%' is a reserved symbol in most software packages so the word 'percent' was abbreviated to 'pct'.)

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The NFHL incorporates all FIRM Databases published by FEMA and any LOMRs that have been issued against those databases since their publication date. The NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed. To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) and/or floodways have been determined, users are encouraged to consult the Flood Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of Stillwater Elevations tables contained within the FIS reports that accompany the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL. Users should be aware that BFEs shown in the S_BFE table may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. These BFEs are intended for flood insurance rating purposes only and should not be used as the sole source of flood elevation information. Accordingly, flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used in conjunction with the FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management. The 1-percent-annual-chance water-surface elevations shown in the S_XS table match the regulatory elevations shown in the FIS report.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>When FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise flood elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM are rounded whole-foot elevations. They must be shown so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.</logic>
    <complete>Data contained in the NFHL reflects the content of the source materials. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces. However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Generally, regulatory water surface elevations and/or regulatory floodways are published only for developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA may generate flood risk data without published water surface elevations. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile and with an average of one foot of flood depth or greater are studied. Note: The NFHL reflects the most current information available when the distribution data set was created. Currently, not all areas of a State or Territory have effective FIRM Database data. As a result, users may need to refer to the effective FIRM for effective flood hazard information.</complete>

Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. The reliability of the floodplain boundary delineation is quantified by comparing the computed flood elevation to the ground elevation at the mapped floodplain boundary. The tolerance for how precisely the flood elevation and the ground elevation must match varies based on the flood risk class, which is a function of population, population density, and/or anticipated growth in floodplain areas. A horizontal accuracy of +/- 38 feet is used to determine the compliance with the vertical tolerances defined for each risk class. The range of differences between the ground elevation (defined from the topographic data used for the Flood Risk Project) and the computed flood elevation is between +/- 1.0 foot at the 95% confidence interval for areas with high population within the floodplain and/or high anticipated growth and Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) with high flood risk to +/- one-half the contour interval at the 85% confidence interval for areas with low population and densities within the floodplain and small or no anticipated growth and SFHAs with low flood risk. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed.</vertaccr>

        <procdesc>The NFHL dataset is a compilation of effective FIRM Databases (a collection of the digital data that are used in GIS systems for creating new Flood Insurance Rate Maps) and Letters of Map Change (Letters of Map Amendment and Letters of Map Revision only) that create a seamless GIS data layer for a State or Territory. It is updated on a monthly basis. The FIRM Databases are compiled in conjunction with the hardcopy FIRMs and the final FIS reports. The specifics of the hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed are detailed in the FIS reports available for each jurisdiction. The results of these studies are submitted in digital format to FEMA. These data and unrevised data from effective FIRMs are compiled onto the base map used for FIRM publication and checked for accuracy and compliance with FEMA standards. As new FIRM Databases are received the individual FIRM layers are sewn into the nationwide layers of the NFHL. LOMRs for the FIRM Databases in the NFHL are cut directly into the NFHL data layers as they are being produced and finalized.</procdesc>

It was noted that sliver polygons existed (primarily in Charlotte County).
However, no methodology was performed by GeoPlan to correct for these issues.
For more information on FEMA's Final Data Structure concerning sliver polygons 
please see below.
The FEMA report frm_gsal.pdf states the following regarding sliver polygons.
L.3.5.2 Topology
Vector data files must meet the following data structure requirements:
* Area spatial features for a given theme must cover the entire study area 
without overlaps, underlaps or sliver polygons between adjacent polygons.

Next Deleted the following 3 features due to spatial errors: 
12123C_10583 (Duplicate Polygon), 
12111C_1676 (Zero Area), 
12097C_502 (Negative Area).

It was noted that 45 features had vertex counts greater than 500,000. 
Features with large vertex counts are known to cause database analysis crashes and errors. 
The ArcGIS Dice Tool subdivides a feature into smaller features based on a specified vertex limit. This tool is intended as a way to subdivide extremely large features that cause issues with drawing, analysis, editing, and/or performance but are difficult to split up with standard editing and geoprocessing tools. This tool should not be used in any cases other than those where tools are failing to complete successfully due to the size of features.

            <edomvd>Zone VE are coastal high hazard areas where wave action and/or high-velocity water can cause structural damage during the base flood. They are subdivided into elevation zones with BFEs assigned. VE zones are identified using one or more of the following criteria for the base flood conditions: [1] The wave runup zone occurs where the (eroded) ground profile is 3.0 feet or more below the 2-percent wave runup elevation. [2] The wave overtopping splash zone is the area landward of the crest of an overtopped barrier, in cases where the potential 2-percent wave runup exceeds the barrier crest elevation by 3.0 feet or more(ΔR&amp;gt;3.0 feet). (See Subsection D.2.8.2.). [3]  The breaking wave height zone occurs where 3-foot or greater wave heights could occur (this is the area where the wave crest profile is 2.1 feet or more above the total stillwater level). [4] The primary frontal dune zone, as defined in 44 CFR Section 59.1 of the NFIP regulations. For the Pacific Coast only: [5] The high-velocity flow zone is landward of the overtopping splash zone (or area on a sloping beach or other shore type), where the product of depth of flow times the flood velocity squared (hv2) is greater than or equal to 200 ft3/sec2.</edomvd>

(2)Future Conditions: 1% Annual Chance Flood Hazard - Zone X: The flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the 1% annual chance floodplains that are determined based on future-conditions hydrology. No base flood elevations or flood depths are shown within this zone. (3)Area with Reduced Flood Risk due to Levee: Areas where an accredited levee, dike, or other flood control structure has reduced the flood risk from the 1% annual chance flood. See Notes to Users for important information. (4)Area with Flood Risk due to Levee: Areas where a non-accredited levee, dike, or other flood control structure is shown as providing protection to less than the 1% annual chance flood.

Floodways are designated by FEMA and adopted by communities to provide an area that will remain free of development to moderate increases in flood heights due to encroachment on the floodplain. Normal floodways are specified as ‘FLOODWAY.’ NOTE: The symbol ‘%’ is a reserved symbol in most software packages, so the word ‘percent’ was abbreviated to ‘PCT.’ Acceptable values for this field are listed in the D_Zone_Subtype table.</attrdef>

            <edomvd>Shaded Zone X: 1% annual chance flood hazards with average depths of less than 1 foot. This zone is classified as being within the 500 year floodplain and not the 100 year floodplain because of the following:  Flood zones AH and AO reference a base flood depth between 1 and 3 feet.  This is in place of a Base Flood Elevation.  An area that has a base flood depth below 1 foot is considered to be flood zone X, since the area affected by the 100 year flooding event would be too shallow or too small to identify on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.

If the flood hazard areas shown on the effective FIRM shall be designated as “dual” flood insurance rate zones (i.e., Zone AR/AE, Zone AR/AH, Zone AR/AO, Zone AR/A), this field will be coded as true. It should be false for any for AR Zones that revert to Shaded X. Acceptable values for this field are listed in the D_TrueFalse table. Dual zones (AR/AE) are flood zones with a risk of flooding from other water sources not protected by the flood protection system being restored. This means that despite the completion of a levee repair project, the area will continue to be in a high risk flood zone due to a flooding source other than the AR Zone source. In this situation, flood insurance purchase requirements apply.</attrdef>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The DFIRM Database is made up of several data themes containing both spatial and attribute information. These data together represent the current flood risk for the subject area as identified by FEMA. The attribute tables include SFHA locations, flood zone designations, BFEs, political entities, cross-section locations, FIRM panel information, and other data related to the NFIP.</eaover>
      <eadetcit>Appendix L of FEMA's Guidelines and Specifications for FEMA Flood Hazard Mapping Partners contains a detailed description of each attribute code and a reference to other relevant information. The following tables are included in this data set: l_comm_info l_stn_start study_info s_bfe s_base_index s_firm_pan s_fld_haz_ar s_fld_haz_ln s_gen_struct s_label_ld s_perm_bmk s_pol_ar s_pol_ln s_quad_index s_wtr_ln s_xs s_label_pt

Attribute Definition Information can be found in the following reference:

    <distliab>The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources) who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist. Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties or representations as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the data provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no representations or warranties about the quality or suitability of the materials, either expressly or implied, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center shall not be liable for any damages suffered as a result of using, modifying, contributing or distributing the materials. A note about data scale: Scale is an important factor in data usage. Certain scale datasets are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes. Please be sure you are using the best available data. 1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the county level. 1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such as property parcel boundaries. 1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the multi-county or regional level. 1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the regional or state level or larger. Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact section of this documentation. For more information regarding scale and accuracy, see our webpage at: http://geoplan.ufl.edu/education.html</distliab>
